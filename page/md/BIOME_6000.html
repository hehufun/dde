                  Summary description. The file contains BIOME 6000 reconstructions of
                  vegetation at 0, 6, and 21ka at individual sites, where the original
                  published nomenclature for individual regions has been converted to a
                  globally-applicable standardized classification (BIOME 6000 Consolidated
                  Name). Two other standardized classifications are also given: common
                  biome names between BIOME 6000 and the BIOME 4.2 model (BIOME 4.2 BIOME
                  6000 common names) and the megabiome scheme used by Harrison and
                  Bartlein (2012) (MegaBiome Scheme 2). Additional information to
                  translate BIOME 4.2 outputs into either BIOME 6000 Consolidated Names or
                  BIOME 4.2 BIOME 6000 common names is also given.<br />

                  The Palaeovegetation Mapping Project (known as BIOME 6000: Prentice and
                  Webb, 1998) was set up under the auspices of the International
                  Geosphere-Biosphere Programme to provide reconstructions of vegetation
                  patterns for the mid-Holocene (MH, 6ka) and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM,
                  21ka), explicitly for comparison with vegetation simulations made either
                  using vegetation-enabled climate models or by running a biogeography
                  model driven by outputs from climate models. BIOME 6000 developed an
                  approach to translate pollen assemblages into vegetation reconstructions
                  (biomization) which involved classification of individual pollen taxa
                  into plant functional types (PFTs), the characterization of major
                  vegetation types (biomes) according to their characteristic or defining
                  PFTs and the application of an algorithm to select the most likely biome
                  represented at a site (Prentice et al., 1996). BIOME 6000 initially
                  produced maps for individual regions: Europe (Prentice et al., 1996),
                  Africa and the Arabian Peninsula (Jolly et al., 1998), the Former Soviet
                  Union and Mongolia (Tarasov et al., 1998) and China (Yu et al., 1998).
                  Additional regions were subsequently added including Beringia (Edwards
                  et al., 2000), western North America (Thompson and Anderson, 2000),
                  Canada and the eastern United States (Williams et al., 2000) and Japan
                  (Takahara et al., 2000), and the data for northern Eurasia (Tarasov et
                  al., 2000), China (Yu et al., 2000) and southern Europe and Africa
                  (Elenga et al., 2000) were updated. A more comprehensive biomisation
                  scheme was applied to the circum-Arctic region as part of the Pan-Arctic
                  INitiative (PAIN: Bigelow et al., 2003), and biomisation was also
                  carried for Australasia (Pickett et al., 2004) and South America
                  (Marchant et al., 2009). Additional Chinese sites were included in biome
                  reconstructions produced by Harrison et al. (2001) and Ni et al. (2010).
            </p>
            <p>
                  There was no attempt to standardize the biome terminology used for these
                  regional compilations, and inevitably both the number of biomes
                  recognized and PFT composition of individual biomes varied between
                  regions. No attempt was made to standardize the nomenclature in the
                  first set of global maps produced by Prentice et al. (2000). The lack of
                  standardization makes comparison with model outputs difficult. Harrison
                  and Bartlein (2012) produced an homogenized and very much simplified
                  (megabiome) classification of the BIOME 6000 data and this has been used
                  in subsequent data-model comparisons (e.g. Braconnot et al., 2012; Bragg
                  et al., 2013) but involves considerable loss of information. The
                  biogeography model BIOME4.2 has been recommended as a tool to convert
                  climate-model outputs into vegetation distributions for comparison with
                  palaeodata for palaeoclimate experiments in the current phase of the
                  Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, CMIP6 (see e.g. Kagayama et al.,
                  2016). Bigelow et al. (2003) deliberately used biome names and
                  definitions to match the biomes simulated by BIOME4.2 (Kaplan et al.,
                  2003), but unfortunately this direct match only applies to sites north
                  of 55Â°N and is not the case for other BIOME 6000 sites.
            </p>
            <p>
                  In the current data set has been produced in order to facilitate the use
                  of BIOME 6000 for evaluation of the MH and LGM experiments in CMIP6. The
                  file includes standardized biome names for the BIOME 6000 data set,
                  translations of the BIOME 6000 names to BIOME4.2 biomes, a
                  globally-applicable translation between BIOME 6000 and BIOME 4.2, and a
                  simplified Megabiome scheme which could be used for comparisons with
                  other vegetation models.

            <p>
                  Column A: Target Age (ka). This gives the assigned age of the sample in
                  kiloyears BP, where the three periods are modern (0), mid-Holocene (6)
                  and Last Glacial Maximum (21).<br />
                  Column B: Site Name. This gives the assigned name of the site in the
                  original publication.<br />
                  Column C: Latitude. This gives the latitude of the site in decimal
                  degrees.<br />
                  Column D: Longitude. This gives the longitude of the site in decimal
                  degrees.<br />
                  Column E: BIOME 6000 Consolidated Name. This gives the biome name as in
                  the globally-applicable BIOME 6000 standardized classification. There
                  are 32 distinct biomes recognized in this standardized classification
                  (see Table 1).<br />
                  Column F: BIOME 6000 biome code. This gives a code for each of the
                  biomes in the globally-applicable BIOME 6000 standardized
                  classification.<br />
                  Column G: BIOME 4.2 Biome 6000 common biomes. This gives the name of the
                  set of biomes that is common between BIOME 6000 reconstructions and
                  Biome 4.2 globally. This is a reduced set of biomes compared to those
                  given in Column K, consisting of 16 biomes (see Table 1). Some of the
                  amalgamations are necessitated by differences between the level of biome
                  discrimination in the BIOME 6000 data set (e.g. distinctive types of
                  tundra biomes differentiated in both BIOME 4.2 and the PAIN data set are
                  lumped into a single category because these distinctions were not made
                  in other regional reconstructions) and some are necessitated by
                  ambiguities in the assignment of BIOME 6000 biomes to BIOME 4.2 biomes
                  (e.g. whereas cold mixed forest and cool mixed forest are recognised in
                  both BIOME 6000 and BIOME 4.2, the reconstructed biome cool-temperate
                  evergreen needleleaf and mixed forest shares characteristics of both and
                  is not discriminated by BIOME 4.2; the three classes are therefore
                  amalgamated in the common biomes list).<br />
                  Column H: MegaBiomes (Scheme 2). This gives the biomes as defined in the
                  megabiome classification scheme of Harrison and Bartlein (2012). There
                  are 8 biomes recognised in this scheme (see Table 1). These biomes are
                  sufficiently broadly defined that they should be compatible with most of
                  the vegetation schemes used by climate models.<br />
                  Column I: BIOME 4.2 names from model code. This gives the names used in
                  the Biome 4.2 code for outputs. These names can be directly translated
                  into the biome names used by Bigelow et al. (2003) but were shortened in
                  the model code for convenience.<br />
                  Column J: Biome 4.2 code. This gives the code for the BIOME 4.2 biomes
                  as output by the model. Note that these code numbers are not the same as
                  for the BIOME 6000 equivalent biomes.<br />
                  Column K: BIOME4.2 BIOME 6000-equivalencies. This gives the exact
                  equivalents between the BIOME 6000 consolidated names and the BIOME 4.2
                  biome names. In cases where there is no one-to-one equivalence, multiple
                  model biomes may be indicated. For example, the biome designated as
                  steppe in the BIOME 6000 data set could be equivalent to the simulated
                  biomes temperate xerophytic shrubland, tropical xerophytic shrubland,
                  temperate grassland or tropical grassland.
