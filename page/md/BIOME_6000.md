## Dataset

Title: BIOME 6000 DB classified plotfile version 1
Summary description. The file contains BIOME 6000 reconstructions of vegetation at 0, 6, and 21ka at individual sites, where the original published nomenclature for individual regions has been converted to a globally-applicable standardized classification (BIOME 6000 Consolidated Name). Two other standardized classifications are also given: common biome names between BIOME 6000 and the BIOME 4.2 model (BIOME 4.2 BIOME 6000 common names) and the megabiome scheme used by Harrison and Bartlein (2012) (MegaBiome Scheme 2). Additional information to translate BIOME 4.2 outputs into either BIOME 6000 Consolidated Names or BIOME 4.2 BIOME 6000 common names is also given.

### Background

The Palaeovegetation Mapping Project (known as BIOME 6000: Prentice and Webb, 1998) was set up under the auspices of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme to provide reconstructions of vegetation patterns for the mid-Holocene (MH, 6ka) and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21ka), explicitly for comparison with vegetation simulations made either using vegetation-enabled climate models or by running a biogeography model driven by outputs from climate models. BIOME 6000 developed an approach to translate pollen assemblages into vegetation reconstructions (biomization) which involved classification of individual pollen taxa into plant functional types (PFTs), the characterization of major vegetation types (biomes) according to their characteristic or defining PFTs and the application of an algorithm to select the most likely biome represented at a site (Prentice et al., 1996). BIOME 6000 initially produced maps for individual regions: Europe (Prentice et al., 1996), Africa and the Arabian Peninsula (Jolly et al., 1998), the Former Soviet Union and Mongolia (Tarasov et al., 1998) and China (Yu et al., 1998). Additional regions were subsequently added including Beringia (Edwards et al., 2000), western North America (Thompson and Anderson, 2000), Canada and the eastern United States (Williams et al., 2000) and Japan (Takahara et al., 2000), and the data for northern Eurasia (Tarasov et al., 2000), China (Yu et al., 2000) and southern Europe and Africa (Elenga et al., 2000) were updated. A more comprehensive biomisation scheme was applied to the circum-Arctic region as part of the Pan-Arctic INitiative (PAIN: Bigelow et al., 2003), and biomisation was also carried for Australasia (Pickett et al., 2004) and South America (Marchant et al., 2009). Additional Chinese sites were included in biome reconstructions produced by Harrison et al. (2001) and Ni et al. (2010).

There was no attempt to standardize the biome terminology used for these regional compilations, and inevitably both the number of biomes recognized and PFT composition of individual biomes varied between regions. No attempt was made to standardize the nomenclature in the first set of global maps produced by Prentice et al. (2000). The lack of standardization makes comparison with model outputs difficult. Harrison and Bartlein (2012) produced an homogenized and very much simplified (megabiome) classification of the BIOME 6000 data and this has been used in subsequent data-model comparisons (e.g. Braconnot et al., 2012; Bragg et al., 2013) but involves considerable loss of information. The biogeography model BIOME4.2 has been recommended as a tool to convert climate-model outputs into vegetation distributions for comparison with palaeodata for palaeoclimate experiments in the current phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, CMIP6 (see e.g. Kagayama et al., 2016).  Bigelow et al. (2003) deliberately used biome names and definitions to match the biomes simulated by BIOME4.2 (Kaplan et al., 2003), but unfortunately this direct match only applies to sites north of 55Â°N and is not the case for other BIOME 6000 sites.

In the current data set has been produced in order to facilitate the use of BIOME 6000 for evaluation of the MH and LGM experiments in CMIP6. The file includes standardized biome names for the BIOME 6000 data set, translations of the BIOME 6000 names to BIOME4.2 biomes, a globally-applicable translation between BIOME 6000 and BIOME 4.2, and a simplified Megabiome scheme which could be used for comparisons with other vegetation models.

### File structure

Column A: Target Age (ka). This gives the assigned age of the sample in kiloyears BP, where the three periods are modern (0), mid-Holocene (6) and Last Glacial Maximum (21).
Column B: Site Name. This gives the assigned name of the site in the original publication.
Column C: Latitude. This gives the latitude of the site in decimal degrees.
Column D: Longitude. This gives the longitude of the site in decimal degrees.
Column E: BIOME 6000 Consolidated Name. This gives the biome name as in the globally-applicable BIOME 6000 standardized classification. There are 32 distinct biomes recognized in this standardized classification (see Table 1).
Column F: BIOME 6000 biome code. This gives a code for each of the biomes in the globally-applicable BIOME 6000 standardized classification.
Column G: BIOME 4.2 Biome 6000 common biomes. This gives the name of the set of biomes that is common between BIOME 6000 reconstructions and Biome 4.2 globally. This is a reduced set of biomes compared to those given in Column K, consisting of 16 biomes (see Table 1). Some of the amalgamations are necessitated by differences between the level of biome discrimination in the BIOME 6000 data set (e.g. distinctive types of tundra biomes differentiated in both BIOME 4.2 and the PAIN data set are lumped into a single category because these distinctions were not made in other regional reconstructions) and some are necessitated by ambiguities in the assignment of BIOME 6000 biomes to BIOME 4.2 biomes (e.g. whereas cold mixed forest and cool mixed forest are recognised in both BIOME 6000 and BIOME 4.2, the reconstructed biome cool-temperate evergreen needleleaf and mixed forest shares characteristics of both and is not discriminated by BIOME 4.2; the three classes are therefore amalgamated in the common biomes list).
Column H: MegaBiomes (Scheme 2). This gives the biomes as defined in the megabiome classification scheme of Harrison and Bartlein (2012). There are 8 biomes recognised in this scheme (see Table 1). These biomes are sufficiently broadly defined that they should be compatible with most of the vegetation schemes used by climate models.
Column I: BIOME 4.2 names from model code. This gives the names used in the Biome 4.2 code for outputs. These names can be directly translated into the biome names used by Bigelow et al. (2003) but were shortened in the model code for convenience.
Column J: Biome 4.2 code. This gives the code for the BIOME 4.2 biomes as output by the model. Note that these code numbers are not the same as for the BIOME 6000 equivalent biomes.
Column K: BIOME4.2 BIOME 6000-equivalencies. This gives the exact equivalents between the BIOME 6000 consolidated names and the BIOME 4.2 biome names. In cases where there is no one-to-one equivalence, multiple model biomes may be indicated. For example, the biome designated as steppe in the BIOME 6000 data set could be equivalent to the simulated biomes temperate xerophytic shrubland, tropical xerophytic shrubland, temperate grassland or tropical grassland.
